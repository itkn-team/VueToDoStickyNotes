##QUICK START
The stack is built using vue-cli webpack so to get started all you have to do is:

```sh
   > npm install -g @vue/cli
   # or
   > yarn global add @vue/cli
```

If you are using npm

```sh
   # install dependencies
   > npm install

   # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
   > npm run serve
```

if you are using yarn
```sh
   # install dependencies
   > yarn install

   # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
   > yarn serve
```

##To know
Current arbitrary choices are:

 - Vuex modules for store
 - Bootstrap for design of the elements
 - Scss as a CSS preprocessor
